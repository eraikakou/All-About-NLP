# Word vectors / Word Embeddings

## Several Representations

1. Integers
1. One Hot Vectors

### One Hot Vectors

**Limitations:**

1. Huge sparse Vector: Space and processing times

1. Don't capture meaning: Another limitation is that this representation doesn't carry the word's meaning. For instance, if you attempt to determine how similar two words are by calculating the distance between their one-hot vectors, then you will always get the same distance between any two pairs of words.
